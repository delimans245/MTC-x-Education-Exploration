Assalamualaikum,

 My name is Ifaz Howlader. I am Education Board of Muslim Tech Collaborative and I am proud to start this intitative for people to share and work on stuff that excites them and provides potential to ignite inspiration in others. 

 On my free time I enjoy playing chess and clash royale. I am a competitive chess player and I have won multiple tournaments in chess. If you are wondering my current chess elo peak is 2246. I aim at being a master one day but it'll surely take time haha!
